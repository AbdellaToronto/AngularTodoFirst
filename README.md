AngularTodoFirst
================

This app is a practice app!

Basically, I am in the process of learning a few different things, and this is the first atttempt at applying these skills.
I'm currently working with Angular.js and Firebase (AngularFire) - and a simple Todo list with general functionality 
is what I am aiming for. 

I'll be iterating on this project, and I may scrap it and start from scratch eventually - only to see if I could do it 
again but faster.
